TECHNICAL TEST

For this technical test, 2 repositories were created, one for the backend in Django <a href="https://github.com/carlosmartinezmolina/djangoApiRest">Api Service</a> and the other for the frontend <a href="https://github.com/carlosmartinezmolina/carlosmartinezmolina.github.io">React Code</a> in react, a version of the frontend without a backend was also deployed, which can be accessed here <a href="https://carlosmartinezmolina.github.io/">Frontend version deployed</a>.

```
In the Task.Component.js file, calls are made to a rest api, so it is necessary to change the url of the getData() and postData() methods to be able to access the url where the api service is deployed.
